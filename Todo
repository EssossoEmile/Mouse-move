********************* Updates **********************

x- Move the mouse if mouse or keyboard has not been interacted with(display the mouse an inch and back to it initial position) for 3 seconds
x- mouse move should be once every second to increase activity %
- Mouse move is only active working when hubstaff(find ways to detect when hubstaff is on) is turn on
- Add to bashrc so it can start authomatically when system starts
